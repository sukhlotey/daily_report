**Deploy branch docs files:** Sunday **January 12, 2025** at 12:03am
(Start)

I try to deploy the docs branch but it not works

And when I explore in internet that how it works:

So there are some lines that says github only allow one deploy link for
one repository and if I want to deploy I need to create directory in
main branch then navigate to that directory.
